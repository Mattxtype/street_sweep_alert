# street_sweep_alert
Hi! This is a small project to get me familiar with some AWS cloud tools. The objective was to write a lambda function that would get publish a message to the SNS service, that would then funnel the message out to any email subscribers.

In addition, I used github workflows to automatically update the lambda function whenever the action file was changed.
